# Patterns

This part covers some common usage patterns for solving practical problems.

## Data Table Based Processing - Attribute Create

<!--From functional scripting, from Excel usage, from Houdini point processing, from limitations of no-lambda LINQ. In Houdini it's the Attribute Wrangler node.-->
<!-- Like Pandas Dataframe -->

We can, through multiple succession of such processing, add attributes to existing table, which can then be used for latter actions.

## Graph as Data

Use graph to define "global" environment variables etc. and export them.
