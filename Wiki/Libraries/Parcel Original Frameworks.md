# Parcel Original Frameworks

> Start with really simple things.

Parcel is generally purpose of course - but that's just the versatility; In terms of utility, it's an interface to one-shot graphs. <!--(Idea from) It's just a better version of Excel, sits between Excel and Matlab, for data analytics - think in terms of a hypothetical Data Service library, where each node is a named entity we want to play with; Think of drag-n-drop RegexRename. -->

* Make simple things trivial
* Make straightforward sense
* Smart contextual behavior

Notable endavours:

* Plotting and 2D graph & table visualization - both real time preview and image generation
* Dashboard-oriented web framework, single-page data-analytics app framework
* Interactive front-end GUI interface building: use Gospel as interface to application functions
