## FAQ

### Why is Gospel (Frontend) Closed Source?

Gospel must ve a separate repo because it's developed independent ly from backend. Because it was WIP I decided to make it private. Then I realize it's a good way to control (potential) profitability (fair share) - only licensers xan access the source. I will definitely share the entire source code when I feel ready. Gospel is known to be one of the conceptually and effort-wise hardest part of the Parcel NExT system because it has GUI.
