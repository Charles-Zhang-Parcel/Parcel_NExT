# Parcel.Neo.Base

Provides frontend agnostic core Parcel logic implemented in Net 7.

## TODO

- [ ] Migrate everything from Parcel.Neo.Base into Parcel except Framework stuff.
- [ ] (Feature Rquest) Preview Window: Add column for easier communication (otherwise people need to count) (A-Z number), and also Row index (e.g. 0-999 number).
- [ ] Remove dependency on Humanizer.
