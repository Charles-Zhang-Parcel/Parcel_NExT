# Parcel.Neo

A Parcel frontend written in WPF using Nodify as node graph framework.

## TODO

Nodes

- [ ] Title-case default node names and node pin names.
- [ ] Gradually reduce Nodify dependencies and make code cleaner/generalized and see whether we can upgrade to the latest version)

Execution states

- [ ] (Nice to have, not essential; Visual indicators) Implement "async" execution states, show/indicate current executing node, execute codes in background, show live status updates of how many nodes remaining and total execution time.
