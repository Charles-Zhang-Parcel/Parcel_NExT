# Overview

Following a traditional desktop application approach (open source, pay for commercial use, paid customers has priority service), Parcel will be published in a *periodical fashion* with clean distribution requirements.

At the moment, we need a clear task requirement system to define what exactly should be included in the Parcel package version 1.
