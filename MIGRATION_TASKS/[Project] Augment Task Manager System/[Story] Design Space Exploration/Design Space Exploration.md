# Overview

Explore the programming options/architecture framework that we can use for evolving the original C# folder-specific .Net Core solution.

# Description

Here are a few goals:

1. Avoid programming as much as possible - explore a process-oriented solution;
2. We are determined to use a compilation process, Github backed repository and all existing Visual Studio Code editing environment - aka. the frontend is only for viewing process. See what existing tools we can utilize to craft such an integrated process instead of writing new tools.
3. Explore whether we can support collaboration simply through a convention surronding using Github repos instead of requiring a long-running server; Consider using Github CI/CD for automatically compiling static HTML pages from new commits of Markdown files.
