# Overview

When Parcel Prototype V1 is ready [#000008], we must re-design and re-write the program so it meets the reliability requirement for a production-level program; thus ready for the general public.

Reliability is the primary goal, surpassing even minor performance improvements, and usability/versatility is as important as GUI/UX.

# Description

The rewrite should meet the following constraint (this will update based on latest estimates):

1. It contains a clean WPF + ASP.Net Core application, without dependancies on SFML
2. It has new, minimally design, polished GUI and interface experience
3. It supports robust extension/plugin/add on system
4. Its node library, saving/loading behavior, server (headless) behavior are well documented

# Destination

* A new github repo.

# Notes

* As UX goes, we might be able to ask Hanrui for a UX review and potential onboarding/tutorial instructions.

# Progress

* 20220511: Initial planning.
