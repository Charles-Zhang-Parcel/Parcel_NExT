# Overview

As Prototype V1 is well functional, we can think of making it into an alpha product just to test the overall usability of this workflow based approach.

# Description

This just uses the prototype program; The purpose is to test workflow and optimize overall usability. This is not intended for general public use! Try to keep management overhaul low and kepp the program clean so we are easier to do rewriting.

# Destination
