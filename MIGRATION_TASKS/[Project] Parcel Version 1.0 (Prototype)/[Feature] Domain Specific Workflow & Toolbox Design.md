# Overview

Parcel prototype V1 is functional now. Besides a few obvious *UX/Usability improvements* (quick node searching and creation from dragging and shortcut keys), *framework support for Toolbox extension, python and Procedural context* (including Vincent's demand for cloud-based service), and basic stability/completeness implementation (node serialization, placeholder nodes), the most important part at this moment is to do **domain-specific workflow design and toolbox implementation**.

# Description

Here are some **"domains"** of prominent interest:

1. Finance/OTPP Data Analysis
2. Office Automation (Mouse and Keyboard)
3. Dashboard Creation
4. PDF/Excel/PNG Report Formatting

# Destination

* Parcel Prototype V1

# Progress

* 20220520: Formalize task.
