Title: Excel-Complete (for Common Functions)

# Overview

Overview of task.

# Description

Mostly two aspects:

1. Data Table editing
2. Excel formulas

We will NOT:

1. Provide data table theming/coloring and all that visual stuff yet
2. Provide excel formulas as is - We will instead devise a workflow/Parcel way for approaching those tasks that Excel formulas intend to solve

We will optionally also do:

1. Implement equivalent and replacement for Excel data-base/data-source related functions

# Destination

* Parcel V1 implementation.
