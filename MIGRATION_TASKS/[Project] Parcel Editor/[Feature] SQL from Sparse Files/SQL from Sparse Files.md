# Overview

We should explore and make it explicit that being able to utilize SQL directly for query, modeling and computation purpose is one major feature of our application.

# Description

I think it would make it more apparent and appealing if:

* Our final program is really small and self-contained in size (*ideally a single-file*), so people initially don't expect much from it: and it can even be that for some people, doing SQL queries on tables without creating a database is all they want to do with it.
