# Overview

Business is serious, but software can be more vibrant especially for modern business.

# Description

Explore ways around animation, colorful UI design, and methodologies of software usage to enhance the overall "joy" of using this app.

For instance, one direction we can explore is the "technical analyst" along the line of Houdini users: having lots of power but each application focuses on one aspect at a time, technical in an iterative and scripting and procedural way but not about programming and debugging at a low level, focus on analyzing and procedural generation and modeling.

Besides **iterative interactivity on data operations**, we can also explore general GUI vibrance along the line of Davinci Resolve - make it "*designer-oriented*" rather than office workers or technical nerds oriented: through clever use of **colors**, **layouts** and certain **helpful GUI hints** (e.g. many ways of visualizing and experimenting with data, emphasis reuse and instancing of nodes as much as possible to encourage even more iterative design, encourage super-fast software booting and quick scratch use like Octave/Matlab for ordinary computational and *data-processing tasks*), we make this working environment *welcoming, fun, and inspiring*.
