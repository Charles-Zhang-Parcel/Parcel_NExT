# Overview

Casually read and take notes - don't intend to use them as references at all: but intend to gain inspirations on how we might further improve those tools by looking at what features they currently have.

# Description

* Node style references: UE4 Blueprint Nodes, Blender Nodes, TerraGen Nodes, World Machine Nodes, Houdini Nodes, World Machine Nodes, Grasshooper Nodes. Â¶We will be mostly following World Machine for its clarity and flow directions.
    * Study Houdini PDG and World Machine node flow and related implementation algorithms for our programming needs.
* Read and see what Tableau and Power BI offer and whether there are elements we can borrow and what areas can we improve. Notice those two fall into the catagory of "data visualization" and "business intelligence", and we should implement this separate from both **data storage** and **data processing/data analysis/machine learning**.
    * For Tableau, we can explore whether it's *easily* possible to extend (ideally through extensions rather than as core functionality) Parcel for such client-facing visualization purpose.
    * Study those comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerBI/comments/glepgr/power_bi_vs_tableau/, https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/q896yh/do_companies_use_tableau_or_powerbi_more/, https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerBI/comments/9r3p11/power_bi_vs_tableau/
    * Also notice for "business intelligence/data visualization/reporting" use, **look is everything**! "Enterprise BI tools are undervalued by data scientists. They are a very quick and easy way to provide customers with a slick UX, which can make a huge difference to selling your solution." Since Power BI is so similar to Excel we don't need to spend more time on it - give Tableau a first-hand trial and see what it can do so we gain more inspirations and learn how it does things.

# Destination

* Study above and make **use references** including design specs etc - no need to take notes about those existing platforms - make original design decisions for our own solution and put directly inside **Notes** or **Designs** folder.
