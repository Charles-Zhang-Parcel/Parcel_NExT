Essential Elements:

1. Node graph for placing and layout nodes and define data logic
2. Save and Load node graphs
3. Referencing node graphs with inputs and outputs
4. Since we always assume a minimum mouse + keyboard scenario, *there should NOT be overlap between mouse and keyboard functionalities in general* - i.e. since there is already `Ctrl+S` for saving, there need not be a button for the same function.
