# Interactive Python

A standalone wrapper process working around the GIL limit of python - we have to have such processes in order to communicate with multiple standalone pythons. (Likely the same thing applies to C#/Pure)

This is mostly for demonstration purpose or Python-only standalone graph use and won't be supporting interoperation with C#.
