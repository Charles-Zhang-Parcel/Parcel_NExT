# Parcel.NExT Backend

Originally we planned only Merlin, which is REST server, because we intended to use NodeJS for frontend and REST is typical for such web applications.  
However, Gospel seems having more potential, and we should have a plain websocket based server, because that way it's more integrated and less moving parts.
