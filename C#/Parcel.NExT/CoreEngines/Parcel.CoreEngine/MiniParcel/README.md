# Mini Parcel Services

MiniParcel is part of Core Engine because its syntax is used not only in the MiniParcel (Front-End), but also in many other places, including being used as a DSL script for specifying node network (quickly drafting node definitions), and for resolving attribute connections. See Parcel Open Standards for more details.
