# MiniParcel

MiniParcel REPL and evaluation engine for Parcel NExT. MiniParcel can digest nodes/functions from those sources: system commands (available from PATH), C# functions and classes, Python functions and classes.

(Note: In terms of implementation, might be able to just make use of existing Ama runtime engine/service provider.)
