# Relic (Express Parcel Windows Desktop Frontend)

A quick and limited C# WPF based graph editor for Windows Desktop while we are still working on the full version in NodeJS. This is based on [NodeNetwork](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NodeNetwork/) rather than Nodify like the V1 Prototype for its API simplicity and program driven pattern.
