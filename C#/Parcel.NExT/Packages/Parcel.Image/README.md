# Parcel.Image

Represents a most basic image. Provide strongly typed interoperation type for all other packages. This library is not intended to be super performant, but efficient enough and highly straightforward.  
This package doesn't depend on any external libraries so whatever that's offered here is limited to what we write by hand.
