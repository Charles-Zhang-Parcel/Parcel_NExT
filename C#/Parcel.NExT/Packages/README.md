# Parcel Packages (Official)

Naming conventions:

* Assembly name IS the package name.
* Using C#-suitable namespace and type names are recommended - though do recognize that we will directly display those names in the front end.
* In general, namespaces should be more "functional" or "descriptive" or "catogorical" than type specific.
