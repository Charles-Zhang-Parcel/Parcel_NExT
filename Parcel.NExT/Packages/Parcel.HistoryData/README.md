# Parcel.HistoryData

Offers API for accessing https://github.com/Charles-Zhang-Investment/HistoryDataService in different flavours: timeseries (`(DateTime, double)` tuple arrays), CSV (text) (which can be converted to DataGrid manually), and strongly typed objects.
APIs are provided at two levels: Named (entity as node), and not named (with string identifier).
