RFC: PENDING

A SQL based functional paradigm dataflow processing framework. Consumes various tabular source formats and process using SQL.

We must make sure we write good post/blog, user manual/documentation, YouTube video/animation to introduce this library way otherwise it could easily get ignored and wasted because it's too powerful a paradigm on its own.
